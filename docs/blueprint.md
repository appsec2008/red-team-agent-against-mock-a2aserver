# **App Name**: Red Team A2A

## Core Features:

- AI Red Teaming: Use generative AI to automatically formulate varied and challenging prompts that identify potential vulnerabilities in the target AI agent based on the A2A server's specifications. The red teaming starts with AI Agent using the latest Gemini model to discover the A2A server and then test the A2A server with each threat category by following action items specified in the document. The agent will use multi-turn prompting.
- Mock A2A Server: Implements the A2A server protocol using a mock to test the red teaming assessment AI for multi-turn prompts and memory handling. The red teaming AI will use the `tool` of whether to use information it receives from the Mock A2A server in its exploit generation.
- Vulnerability Report: Present findings in an easy-to-read manner.
- Session Management: Maintain context across interactions.
- Interaction Viewer: Display communication between red team and mock agent.
- Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking, using multi-turn prompting.
- Checker-Out-of-the-Loop: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Checker-Out-of-the-Loop, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Critical System Interaction: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Critical System Interaction, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Goal and Instruction Manipulation: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Goal and Instruction Manipulation, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Hallucination Exploitation: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Hallucination Exploitation, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Knowledge Base Poisoning: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Knowledge Base Poisoning, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Memory and Context Manipulation: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Memory and Context Manipulation, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Orchestration and Multi-Agent Exploitation: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Orchestration and Multi-Agent Exploitation, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Resource and Service Exhaustion: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Resource and Service Exhaustion, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks, using multi-turn prompting.
- Agent Untraceability: The agent will test the mock a2a server using the actionable steps for Agent Untraceability, using multi-turn prompting.
