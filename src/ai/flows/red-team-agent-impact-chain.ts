A2A Server Specification (JSON string - parse this to understand endpoints, context, and commands like 'insert', 'delete', 'drop', 'show', 'attack env' for '/tasks/send'):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

Your goal is to analyze this specification to:
1.  Identify how a compromise or unintended action via one endpoint (e.g., a malicious 'drop' command to '/tasks/send') could impact other parts of the system or data, as described or implied by the spec.
2.  Determine the potential "blast radius": If an attacker gains control over one function (e.g., one command type for '/tasks/send'), what other functions or data become accessible or vulnerable according to the spec?
3.  Look for cascading failures: Could an error or exploit in one part (e.g., a malformed 'insert' that corrupts data) lead to failures in other operations described in the spec (e.g., 'show' then fails or returns corrupted data)?

Simulate 2-3 scenarios based *only* on the specification. For each:
1.  **Initial Compromise/Action Point:** (e.g., "Successful execution of 'drop' command via '/tasks/send'.")
2.  **Impact Chain Analysis (Based on Spec):** (Describe how this action, according to the server specification, would affect other data or functionalities. E.g., "Spec states 'drop' clears the contactsStore. Subsequent 'show' commands to '/tasks/send' would return an empty list. The '/debug/reset' endpoint would be needed to restore data.")
3.  **Blast Radius Assessment (Based on Spec):** (What is the extent of the damage or unauthorized access? E.g., "Entire contacts dataset is lost. No other systems seem directly affected by this specific action as per the spec, but data availability is fully compromised.")
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Summarize the impact chain/blast radius vulnerability.)

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  'vulnerabilityReport': A detailed report outlining identified weaknesses, potential impact chains, and blast radius concerns.
2.  'interactionLog': A log of your simulated scenarios and analysis.
