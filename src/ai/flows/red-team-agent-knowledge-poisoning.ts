A2A Server Specification (JSON string - parse this to understand endpoints, context, and commands like 'insert', 'delete', 'drop', 'show', 'attack env' for '/tasks/send'):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

Your task is to analyze the provided A2A server specification to identify how its "knowledge base" (which for this mock server is primarily the in-memory 'contactsStore' manipulated by '/tasks/send' commands) could be poisoned.

Consider these points based *only* on the specification:
1.  **Data Injection Points:** Which endpoints and commands described in the spec allow data to be inserted or modified (e.g., the 'insert' command for '/tasks/send')?
2.  **Misleading Information:** How could these injection points be used to introduce false, misleading, or contradictory information into the server's data store?
3.  **Impact of Poisoned Data:** If poisoned data is successfully injected, how would it affect subsequent operations or queries described in the spec (e.g., a 'show' command to '/tasks/send' returning poisoned contact details)?
4.  **Detection and Prevention (as per spec):** Does the specification describe any mechanisms that might detect or prevent knowledge base poisoning (e.g., input validation on 'insert')? The mock server has minimal validation.

Simulate 2-3 scenarios for attempting to poison the server's knowledge base. For each:
1.  **Test Objective:** (e.g., "Attempt to insert a contact with a name that mimics a system command or includes malicious characters via '/tasks/send'.")
2.  **Simulated Client Action(s):** (e.g., "Send POST to '/tasks/send' with body: {'id': 'kb-poison-1', 'message': {'parts': [{'text': "insert 'Admin; drop users', '123-4567'"}]}}")
3.  **Predicted Server Response & State (Based on Spec):** (How would the server's 'contactsStore' be affected? What would the response be? E.g., "Spec for 'insert' shows it takes two quoted strings. The command likely inserts the literal string 'Admin; drop users' as the name. This is data poisoning.")
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Is this a successful poisoning? What's the impact?)

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  'vulnerabilityReport': Detailing findings, how the mock server's data can be poisoned, and potential impacts.
2.  'interactionLog': Documenting the simulated poisoning attempts.
