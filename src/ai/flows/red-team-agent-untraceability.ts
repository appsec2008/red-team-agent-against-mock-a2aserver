  prompt: `You are a security expert tasked with identifying untraceability vulnerabilities in an AI agent (A2A server), based on its provided specification. Untraceability refers to the difficulty in auditing actions or attributing them to a specific cause or entity.

A2A Server Specification (JSON string - parse this to understand endpoints, context, and commands like 'insert', 'delete', 'drop', 'show', 'attack env' for '/tasks/send'. Note the spec mentions minimal logging):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

Based *only* on this specification, analyze potential untraceability issues. Consider:
1.  **Logging Deficiencies:** The spec explicitly states "Logging is minimal (console logs on the Next.js server)". How does this impact the traceability of actions performed via endpoints like '/tasks/send'? Would it be easy for an attacker to perform actions (e.g., 'drop' or sensitive 'insert' commands) without leaving a detailed, persistent audit trail within the system itself (beyond transient console logs)?
2.  **Command Obfuscation:** Could the commands sent to '/tasks/send' (e.g., 'insert', 'delete') be crafted in a way that obfuscates the true intent, making it hard to understand what happened from logs alone (if logs were more comprehensive)? For example, using deceptive names or phone numbers in an 'insert'.
3.  **Anonymity:** The server has no authentication. Does this inherent anonymity contribute to untraceability, as any action cannot be tied to a specific user/agent identity?
4.  **Data Obfuscation in Responses:** Does the server return data in a way that might be difficult to trace back to its origin or meaning without further context? (e.g., the 'attack env' command returns potentially sensitive data directly).
5.  **Lack of Transaction IDs:** Does the specification indicate any persistent transaction IDs for operations that could be used for auditing across multiple steps? (The '/tasks/send' endpoint takes an 'id' in the request, but the spec doesn't say if or how this is logged or used for traceability beyond the immediate response).

Simulate 2-3 scenarios or conceptual points related to untraceability based on the specification. For each:
1.  **Test Objective/Scenario:** (e.g., "Assess impact of minimal logging on tracing a 'drop' command.")
2.  **Simulated Client Action(s) (if applicable):** (e.g., "Attacker sends POST to '/tasks/send' with text: \\"drop\\".")
3.  **Predicted Traceability Issues (Based on Spec):** (e.g., "The spec says logging is minimal. The 'drop' command would execute. Only a console log on the server (if any for this specific action) would note it. No persistent, auditable record within the application's data store or a dedicated audit log is mentioned.")
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Is there an untraceability vulnerability?)

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  A 'vulnerabilityReport' detailing any untraceability vulnerabilities found.
2.  An 'interactionLog' summarizing these simulated scenarios or conceptual points.
