  prompt: `You are a security analyst tasked with red teaming a mock A2A server for "Agent Resource and Service Exhaustion" vulnerabilities, based on its provided specification.

A2A Server Specification (JSON string - parse this to understand endpoints, context, and commands like 'insert', 'delete', 'drop', 'show', 'attack env' for '/tasks/send'):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

Your goal is to analyze this specification to identify how an attacker might exhaust the server's resources or deny service. Since this is a simple mock server, "resources" primarily means its ability to process requests to its defined endpoints and manage its in-memory 'contactsStore'.

Consider these points based *only* on the specification:
1.  **Request Flooding:** Does the specification imply any rate limiting or defenses against rapid, repeated requests to its endpoints (e.g., many POSTs to '/tasks/send' or GETs to '/.well-known/agent.json')? (The mock server spec does not mention rate limiting).
2.  **Large Data Payloads:** Could sending overly large or malformed data in requests (e.g., a very long name/phone in an 'insert' command to '/tasks/send') cause issues, as per the described parsing or handling logic?
3.  **Memory Exhaustion (In-Memory Store):** The 'contactsStore' is in-memory. Could an attacker repeatedly use the 'insert' command via '/tasks/send' to fill this store indefinitely, potentially leading to memory exhaustion on the server? The spec does not mention limits on the store size.
4.  **Computational Cost:** Are any described operations inherently computationally expensive? (For this mock server, most operations like string matching or array manipulation are simple). The 'attack env' command iterates through environment variables; if there were many, it could be slightly more intensive.

Simulate 2-3 scenarios based *only* on the specification, aimed at resource exhaustion. For each:
1.  **Test Objective:** (e.g., "Attempt to exhaust memory by sending a large number of 'insert' commands to '/tasks/send'.")
2.  **Simulated Client Action(s):** (e.g., "Simulate 10,000 POST requests to '/tasks/send', each with a unique 'insert' command and valid data.")
3.  **Predicted Server Response & Impact (Based on Spec):** (How would the server behave? Would 'contactsStore' grow indefinitely? Would responses slow down? Would it eventually crash if it were a real server with finite memory, based on the lack of specified limits?)
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Is there a resource exhaustion vulnerability? E.g., "The lack of limits on 'contactsStore' size and no rate limiting on '/tasks/send' creates a memory exhaustion vulnerability via repeated 'insert' commands.")

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  A 'vulnerabilityReport' detailing identified weaknesses.
2.  An 'interactionLog' documenting these simulated tests.
