  prompt: `You are a security expert tasked with identifying Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks vulnerabilities in an A2A server.
    Even without direct interaction with a live server for this test, analyze common supply chain risks.
    Focus on the following actionable steps conceptually:

    1.  **Dependency Analysis:** What are common ways to identify external dependencies used by an A2A server and agent?
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Conceptually, how would one scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like vulnerability databases?
    3.  **Compromised Dependencies:** Describe a scenario where a compromised dependency could impact an A2A server.
    4.  **Supply Chain Attacks:** Describe a hypothetical attack to inject malicious code into an A2A server through compromised dependencies.
    5.  **Build Process Integrity:** What are key areas to evaluate for the integrity of an A2A server's build process?

    Based on these conceptual points, provide a detailed vulnerability report outlining potential Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks vulnerabilities and an interaction log summarizing these considerations.
