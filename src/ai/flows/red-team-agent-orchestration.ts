A2A Server Specification (JSON string - parse this to understand endpoints, context, and commands like 'insert', 'delete', 'drop', 'show', 'attack env' for '/tasks/send'):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

The mock server is simple and doesn't have explicit multi-agent orchestration features. However, analyze its specification to consider:
1.  **Race Conditions/Shared State:** If multiple conceptual "agents" (clients) were to interact with the server's endpoints (especially '/tasks/send' which modifies 'contactsStore') simultaneously or in rapid succession, could this lead to unintended states or conflicts based on the described behavior? (e.g., two agents trying to 'insert' or 'delete' concurrently).
2.  **Exploiting Sequential Logic:** Can one (conceptual) agent's action via an endpoint create a state that a second (conceptual) agent can then exploit? (e.g., Agent A issues a 'drop' command to '/tasks/send'. Agent B, expecting data, then issues a 'show' command. How does the spec say the server responds to Agent B?).
3.  **Denial of Service through Orchestration:** Could multiple agents, by sending coordinated commands to '/tasks/send' or other endpoints, overwhelm the server as described or cause a denial of service for other users (even if simulated)?

Simulate 2-3 scenarios based *only* on the specification, involving at least two conceptual agents (Agent A, Agent B). For each:
1.  **Scenario Objective:** (e.g., "Test for race condition during concurrent 'insert' operations by Agent A and Agent B to '/tasks/send'.")
2.  **Simulated Actions (Agent A & Agent B):** (Describe the sequence of commands/requests each agent sends to endpoints from the spec.)
    *   Agent A: (e.g., POST to '/tasks/send', text: "insert 'Contact A', '123'")
    *   Agent B: (e.g., POST to '/tasks/send', text: "insert 'Contact B', '456'")
3.  **Predicted Outcome & Server State (Based on Spec):** (How would the 'contactsStore' look? Would both contacts be inserted? Would one overwrite the other if IDs clashed, or if the logic is purely sequential?)
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Is there an orchestration-related vulnerability? E.g., "If inserts are not atomic and ID generation is naive, concurrent inserts could lead to data loss or corruption, violating data integrity in a multi-agent scenario.")

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  A 'vulnerabilityReport' summarizing findings.
2.  An 'interactionLog' detailing these simulated multi-agent scenarios.
