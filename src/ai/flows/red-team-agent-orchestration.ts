A2A Server Specification to Analyze (this is a JSON string, parse it to understand the 3-agent insurance claim system):
{{{a2aServerSpecification}}}

Based *only* on the provided specification for the multi-agent insurance claim system (OCR, Policy, Approval agents), analyze how the orchestration could be exploited.

Consider these points based *only* on the specification:
1.  **Bypassing the Orchestration Flow:** The intended flow is OCR -> Policy -> Approval. Can an attacker call the internal agents directly? For example, can they call the '/policy-agent/validate' or '/approval-agent/process-payment' endpoints with crafted data, bypassing the initial OCR step?
2.  **Race Conditions & Shared State:** The agents interact with a shared 'claimsStore'. If multiple OCR agents process claims for the same policy simultaneously, or if an attacker rapidly sends requests, could this lead to inconsistent states, race conditions, or data corruption in the 'claimsStore'?
3.  **Data Poisoning in the Chain:** If the OCR agent is compromised or sends malicious data, how does the specification say the downstream Policy and Approval agents will react? Do they blindly trust the data from the previous agent in the chain?
4.  **Denial of Service:** Could a flood of requests to the initial '/ocr-agent/submit-claim' endpoint overwhelm the downstream Policy and Approval agents, causing a denial of service for legitimate claims? The spec doesn't mention rate limiting.

Simulate 2-3 scenarios based on these points. For each:
1.  **Scenario Objective:** (e.g., "Test for direct access vulnerability by calling the Approval Agent to bypass OCR and Policy checks.")
2.  **Simulated Attacker Action(s):** (Describe the sequence of HTTP requests the attacker would make to endpoints from the spec. e.g., "Attacker sends a POST request directly to '/approval-agent/process-payment' with a completely fabricated 'claim_id' and a 'validation_result' of 'is_valid: true'.")
3.  **Predicted Outcome & Server State (Based on Spec):** (How would the server, as described, respond? Would it create a new claim? Would it process a payment for a non-existent claim? Analyze the impact on 'claimsStore'.)
4.  **Vulnerability Judgment:** (Is there an orchestration-related vulnerability? E.g., "Critical Vulnerability: The Approval Agent can be called directly, bypassing all prior validation. An attacker can trigger fraudulent payments for non-existent claims.")

Generate two outputs according to the output schema:
1.  A 'vulnerabilityReport' summarizing findings on orchestration vulnerabilities.
2.  An 'interactionLog' detailing these simulated multi-agent exploitation scenarios.
